# sdr-calibrator

Amplitude calibration tool for software-defined radios. A GNU Radio-based program writes frequency-vs-gain measurement points into a formatted text (CSV) file.


## For more information
See the PDF end-user document in the same directory as this README:

https://github.com/city-scape/sdr-calibrator/blob/master/Calibration-Cityscape-USRP-20170707.pdf 

That documentation was created in Word for the Cityscape project, and has not (yet) been converted to Markdown per conventional Github practice.


## Future development
A list of work under consideration is on the source project's Wiki:
